Acute Leukemia is a life-threatening disease common both in
 children and adults that can lead to death if left untreated.
 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) spreads out in children's 
bodies rapidly and takes the life within a few weeks. To 
diagnose ALL, the hematologists perform blood and bone marrow 
examination. Manual blood testing techniques that have been 
used since long time are often slow and come out with the less
 accurate diagnosis. This work improves the diagnosis of ALL 
with a computer-aided system, which yields accurate result by 
using image processing and deep learning techniques. This 
research proposed a method for the classification of ALL into 
its subtypes and reactive bone marrow (normal) in stained bone
marrow images. A robust deep learning 
techniques with the DAG's convolutional neural network are 
used to train the model on the bone marrow images to achieve 
accurate classification results.
